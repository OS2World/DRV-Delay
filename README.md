# DRV-Delay
DELAY is a simple OS/2 device driver for providing a timed delay from CONFIG.SYS during system startup. It is useful in situations where several machines are being brought up at the same time, but some must not proceed past a certain point until others are fully functional. It is also very useful when a message from some device driver scrolls by on the screen too fast to be read or analyzed.
